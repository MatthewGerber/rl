### [rlai.gpi.state_action_value.function_approximation.FunctionApproximationPolicy](https://github.com/MatthewGerber/rlai/tree/master/src/rlai/gpi/state_action_value/function_approximation/__init__.py#L617)
```
Policy for use with function approximation methods. This is effectively an interface to the underlying function
    approximation estimator and its reward model, which are accessed by indexing the policy with a state (e.g., a call
    like `agent.pi[state]`), which returns an action-probability dictionary.
