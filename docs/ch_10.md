### [rlai.policies.function_approximation.FunctionApproximationPolicy](https://github.com/MatthewGerber/rlai/tree/master/src/rlai/policies/function_approximation.py#L10)
```
Policy for use with function approximation methods. This is effectively an interface to the underlying function
    approximation estimator and its reward model, which are accessed by indexing the policy with a state (e.g., a call
    like agent.pi[state]), which returns an action-probability dictionary.
